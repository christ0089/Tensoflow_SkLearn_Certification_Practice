# Tensorflow_SkLearn_Certification_Practice

This repo is all the projects I worked on for the Supervised and Classification test from Tensorflow and DeepLearn.


1- Data_Pipelines 
  - We explore the use of transformers and the use of Sklearn's Pipelines to transform dataset and fine tune the hyperparameters
